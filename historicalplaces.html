            <h3>Sinhagad Fort</h3>
            <p>Sinhagad, also known as Kondhana, is an ancient hill fortress located approximately 49 kilometers
                southwest
                of Pune, India. It has a rich history and has witnessed many battles, most notably the Battle of
                Sinhagad in
                1670. The name “Sinhagad” translates to “Lion’s Fort”, signifying its strength and brilliance.
                Here are some key details about Sinhagad:<br></p>
            <h4>Historical Significance</h4><br>
            <p>
                Some evidence suggests that the fort could have been built around 2000 years ago. Caves and carvings in
                the
                Kaundinyeshwar temple support this theory.
                The fort was captured by forces of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1328 after a siege of eight months.
                It then became part of the Bahmani Sultanate and later the Nizam Shahi of Ahmadnagar.
                Shahaji Bhosale, commander of Ibrahim Adil Shah II, gained control of Kondana in 1647.<br>

            <h3>Shaniwar Wada</h3>
            <p>Shaniwar Wada, located in Pune, India, is a historical fortification that played a significant role in
                Maratha history. Here are some fascinating details about this remarkable place:<br></p>
            <h4>Historical Significance</h4><br>
            <p>Built in 1732, Shaniwar Wada served as the great seat of the Peshwas (prime ministers) of the Maratha
                Empire
                until 1818. During the 18th century, it became the center of Indian politics due to the rise of the
                Maratha
                Empire.
                The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are
                now
                maintained as a tourist site. The imposing walls, strong teak gateways, and deep foundations still stand
                as
                a
                testament to its historical significance.
                Legend has it that the ghost of Peshwa Narayanrao, who was murdered in Shaniwar Wada, calls for help on
                full
                moon nights. Visitors and locals have allegedly heard the cries of “Kaka mala vachava” (Uncle, save me)
                by
                Narayanrao Peshwa after his death.</p>
            <h4>Construction</h4><br>
            <p>Peshwa Baji Rao I, prime minister to Chattrapati Shahu, laid the ceremonial foundation of his own
                residence
                on
                Saturday, 10 January 1730. Although the top six stories collapsed after being attacked by British
                artillery,
                the
                stone base of Shaniwar Wada remains and can be seen even today in the older parts of Pune.<br>

            <h3>Lal Mahal</h3>
            <p>Lal Mahal, also known as the Red Palace, is one of the most famous monuments in Pune, India. It holds
                significant historical importance and is closely associated with Shivaji I, the founder of the Maratha
                Empire. Let’s delve into the intriguing history and features of this remarkable place:<br>
            <h4>Historical Significance</h4><br>
            <p>In the year 1630 AD, Shivaji’s father, Shahaji Raje Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife
                Jijabai
                and
                their son, Shivaji.
                Shivaji spent several years in the Lal Mahal until he captured his first fort.
                The original Lal Mahal was built with the intention of rejuvenating the recently razed city of Pune when
                Shahaji
                Raje entered the city along with Shivaji and his mother, Maasaheb Jijabai.
                Young Shivaji grew up within the walls of the Lal Mahal, residing there until he conquered the Torna
                fort in
                1645.
                Notably, Shivaji’s marriage to his first wife, Saibai, took place in the Lal Mahal on 16 May 1640.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Historical Events</h4><br>
            <p>In the year 1630 AD, Shivaji’s father, Shahaji Raje Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife
                Jijabai
                and
                their son, Shivaji.
                Shivaji spent several years in the Lal Mahal until he captured his first fort.
                The original Lal Mahal was built with the intention of rejuvenating the recently razed city of Pune when
                Shahaji
                Raje entered the city along with Shivaji and his mother, Maasaheb Jijabai.
                Young Shivaji grew up within the walls of the Lal Mahal, residing there until he conquered the Torna
                fort in
                1645.
                Notably, Shivaji’s marriage to his first wife, Saibai, took place in the Lal Mahal on 16 May 1640.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Decline and Reconstruction</h4><br>
            <p>Towards the end of the 17th century, the original Lal Mahal fell into ruin due to various attacks on the
                city.
                During the construction of the Shaniwarwada, some soil and stones from the Lal Mahal were used for luck.
                The current Lal Mahal, a reconstruction, stands in the center of Pune. It was built by the Pune
                Municipal
                Corporation between 1984 and 1988.
                The memorial now houses a collection of large-size oil paintings depicting significant events in
                Shivaji’s
                life,
                a statue of Jijabai, a carving showing Shivaji using a gold plow alongside Jijabai, a fiber model of
                Raigad
                with
                horsemen, and a huge map of Maharashtra indicating Shivaji’s forts.<br>

            <h3>Aga Khan Palace</h3>
            <h4>Construction and Purpose:</h4>
            <p>The Aga Khan Palace was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in 1892.
                It stands as an act of charity by the spiritual leader of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims.
                The Sultan’s intention was to help the poor in the neighboring areas of Pune, who were severely affected
                by
                famine. He provided them with employment during the construction of the palace.
                The construction involved hundreds of thousands of people and cost 1.2 million rupees.
            </p>
            <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
            <p>The Aga Khan Palace played a crucial role in the Indian freedom movement.
                During the Quit India Movement, it served as a prison for several prominent leaders, including Mahatma
                Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, and his secretary Mahadev Desai.
                Sarojini Naidu and others were also imprisoned here, demanding an end to British rule in India.
                Tragically, both Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai passed away while in captivity at the palace.
            </p>
            <h4>Memorials and Recognition</h4>
            <p>The Aga Khan Palace is closely linked to Mahatma Gandhi:
                His ashes were kept here, and the palace now houses a memorial dedicated to him.
                Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai also have their Samadhis (memorial shrines) within the same complex,
                near
                the Mula river.
                In 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) declared the site a monument of national importance.
            </p>
            <h4>Current State</h4>
            <p>The palace covers an area of 7.7 hectares (19 acres), with the built-up portion spanning 2.8 hectares
                (6.9
                acres).
                It was once home to a residential co-education school from 1953 to 1972.
                In 1969, Aga Khan IV donated the palace to the Indian people as a mark of respect for Gandhi and his
                philosophy.
                Today, visitors can explore the palace, learn about its history, and pay homage to the great leaders who
                were part of its story.<br>

            <h3>Vishrambaugwada</h3>
            <p>Vishrambaug Wada, situated on Bajirao Road in Pune, Maharashtra, India, is a three-storeyed mansion with
                a
                fascinating history. Let’s delve into its intriguing details:</p>
            <h4>Historical Context</h4>
            <p>Built in 1807 AD by Peshwa Baji Rao II, Vishrambaug Wada served as the luxurious residence of the last
                Peshwa
                of the Maratha confederacy.
                Unlike the ill-fated Shaniwar Wada, Baji Rao II preferred this mansion as his abode.
                The construction took six years to complete, and it cost Rs 200,000.
                Vishrambaug Wada stands as a testament to Pune’s rich culture and heritage.
                Baji Rao II resided here for eleven years until his defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
                After the war, the British exiled him to Bithur near Kanpur, while his wife, Varanasibai, continued to
                stay
                at Vishrambaug Wada for a while.
                In 1821, the East India Company started the Hindoo college within the wada to promote Sanskrit learning
                in
                Pune. This college eventually evolved into the Poona College, which later became Deccan College.
                The wada also housed the Vishrambag High School.
            </p>
            <h4>Architectural Features</h4>
            <p>The wada boasts a fine entrance and a balcony adorned with intricate woodwork.
                Its dimensions are impressive: 260 feet by 815 feet.
                The mansion symbolizes the tales of Pune’s glorious past and its connection to the Peshwa dynasty.
            </p>
            <h4>Transformation and Restoration</h4>
            <p>Over time, the wada served various purposes, including housing the Municipality and its successor, the
                Pune
                Municipal Corporation (PMC).
                In 1871, an act of arson destroyed the eastern wing of the wada.
                In 1930, the PMC purchased the property from the colonial Bombay Presidency government.
                Restoration efforts are ongoing under the Heritage Corridor Plan, with special attention to preserving
                the
                original bricks, windows, wooden pillars, and motifs.
                The red-tiled sloping roof and the courtyard, typical of Maratha architecture, will be retained.

        <h3>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bridge</h3>
        <p>The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bridge, also known as Nava Pul, is celebrating its centenary. Constructed in
            1923, this bridge stands as a testament to both aesthetics and engineering marvel. It has withstood the test
            of time, including the 1961 Panshet floods. The bridge connects Bhamburda to old Pune and is considered a
            Grade-II heritage structure.
            Originally known as the Lloyd Bridge, it was built by Raobahadur Ganpatrao Mahadeo Kenjale during the
            British Rule under the aegis of Sir George Lloyd, the then governor of Bombay Presidency. After India won
            independence, it was renamed the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bridge. This iconic bridge begins at Mangala
            Theatre and alights in front of Shaniwar Wada. Made with black basalt, it not only stands as a testament to
            strong quality work but also boasts delicate carvings on both sides. The bridge serves as a landmark
            connecting PMC with the historic Shaniwar Wada and overseeing Pune’s Public Transport System, PMPML’s hub.
            It spans the Mutha River and has been given Grade-II heritage status by PMC.
            A special celebration is being organized by the Kenjale family on September 17 at 3 pm on the Shaniwar Wada
            side of the bridge. The event is open to all and will include the unveiling of a special documentary made on
            the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bridge. During the commemorative ceremony, the cornerstone marking the
            completion of 100 years of this historic bridge will be laid by Chandrakant Patil, the Guardian Minister of
            Pune. The bridge will be adorned with flowers and traditional ‘rangoli’, and the customary ‘dhol-taasha’
            will add to the festivities.
            This bridge, which initially linked Bhamburda to Pune, stands as a testament to the city’s growth and
            transformation over the past century. On September 16, 1923, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Bridge, known
            as the Victoria Bridge at the time, was inaugurated.<br></p>

        <h3>Shivneri Fort</h3>
        <p>Shivneri Fort, located near Junnar in Pune district, Maharashtra, India, holds historical significance as the
            birthplace of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the visionary founder of the Maratha Empire. </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Shivneri Fort was initially under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. It played a crucial role in
            guarding the old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. Over time, it passed through various
            dynasties, including the Bahmani Sultanate and the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. In 1595, Maloji Bhosale, the
            grandfather of Shivaji Bhosale, was granted control of Shivneri by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam
            Shah. Shivaji himself was born at this fort on February 19, 1630 (some accounts place it in 1627) and spent
            his childhood there. Inside the fort, you’ll find a small temple dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi, after
            whom Shivaji was named.</p>
        <h4>Architecture</h4>
        <p>Shivneri Fort stands atop a hill, shaped like a triangle, with its entrance on the southwest side. The main
            gate and a secondary entrance (locally known as the “chain gate”) provide access. The fort boasts seven
            well-defended gates along its 1-mile (1.6 km) stretch. Mud walls surround the entire fort. Notable
            structures within include a prayer hall, a tomb, a mosque, and an overhanging area where executions took
            place. The central water pond, called “Badami Talav,” adds to the fort’s charm. Statues of Jijabai and a
            young Shiva grace the premises. Additionally, two perennial water springs named Ganga and Yamuna are found
            within the fort. Just 2 kilometers away lies the Buddhist rock-cut caves known as Lenyadri caves, which also
            house one of the Ashtavinayak temples in Maharashtra1.</p>
        <h4>UNESCO Recognition: </h4>
        <p>In 2021, Shivneri Fort was added to the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites as part of the “Serial
            Nomination of Maratha Military Architecture in Maharashtra”.<br></p>

        <h3>Shinde Chhatri</h3>
        <p>Shinde Chhatri, located in Wanawadi, Pune, India, is a memorial dedicated to the 18th-century Maratha
            military leader Mahadji Shinde. Mahadji Shinde served as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army under
            the Peshwas from 1760 to 1780. This significant landmark in the city commemorates the Maratha rule and holds
            historical importance.
            The three-storied memorial, built in Rajput architectural style, marks the spot of Mahadji Shinde’s
            cremation on February 12, 1794. Originally, the complex only had a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, which
            Mahadji Shinde himself constructed. His last rites were performed in the temple premises. Later, in 1910, a
            samadhi (memorial) was added outside the sanctum of the Shiva temple, precisely where he was cremated.
            Maharaja Madho Rao Scindia of Gwalior commissioned the construction of this complex, along with the memorial
            for Mahadji Shinde.
            The architectural grandeur of Shinde Chhatri is remarkable, reflecting the style used in Rajasthan, India.
            The building adheres to Vastu shastra rules and features exquisite carvings. The steeple of the Shiva temple
            showcases idols of saints made of yellow stone, while the base and sanctum sanctorum are constructed in
            black stone. The hall itself houses a gallery and boasts English-style colored window panes. Paintings and
            photographs of Shinde family members adorn the hall, preserving its architectural beauty and design1.
            Despite years of neglect, the memorial is now being restored to its original appearance, ensuring that its
            historical significance endures for generations to come.<br></p>

        <h3>Nana Wada</h3>
        <p>Nana Wada, situated in Budhwar Peth, Pune, is a historic gem that offers a glimpse into the rich Maratha
            history. Let me share some fascinating details about this remarkable place:<br>
            Maratha empire. Its majestic architecture reflects the legacy of Nana Phadnavis, and its sturdy foundations
            testify to its endurance over time.
            The elaborate woodwork, grey stone with white borders, and a flourishing garden contribute to the total
            perfection of Nana Wada. In 1907, Pune’s Deccan Education Society transformed a part of the wada into the
            New English School. The admirable architecture instills a sense of pride, reminding us of the glorious
            Maratha era.
            Nana Wada is situated close to Shaniwar Wada and Vasant Theatre, making it one of the oldest heritage sites
            in the city. Here, you’ll find materialized symbols of the Peshwa dynasty intertwined with colonial
            influences.
            If you plan to visit, do check with the relevant officials, as the place might be temporarily closed due to
            lockdown reforms.<br></p>

        <h3>Bhide Wada</h3>
        <h4>Construction and Background:</h4>
        <p>Bhide Wada was constructed by the Bhide family in a thriving business district of Budhwar Peth during the
            rule of the Peshwas in Pune, before their eventual defeat in 1818.
            These wada-like structures were common across the city in the 18th and 19th centuries, resembling
            traditional cottages.</p>
        <h4>The Phule Connection:</h4>
        <p>In 1848, social reformers Jyotirao and Savitribai Phule established the first indigenous girls’ school of
            modern India within Bhide Wada.
            Despite facing opposition from traditionalists, Savitribai played a pivotal role in changing the course of
            women’s educational activism in modern India.
            Bhide Wada became a center of public activism, attracting prominent figures like Mahadev Govind Ranade and
            Dayanand Saraswati.
            Even after the school’s closure, Bhide Wada continued to be significant, shaping new political and cultural
            expressions in modern India.</p>
        <h4>Demolition and Redevelopment</h4>
        <p>Demolition and Redevelopment:
            On December 5, 2023, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) demolished the old and dilapidated Bhide Wada.
            However, recognizing its historical importance, the state government plans to redevelop it into a national
            memorial to honor the Phule couple’s contribution to modern India.<br></p>
