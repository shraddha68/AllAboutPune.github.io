                the
                Western Coast of India from the Portuguese.
                It also has the Samadhi of Chimaji Appa and his wife Annapurna, who committed sati after his death.

        <h3>Neelkantheshwar Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>As the name suggests, this temple is dedicated to the Lord with the blue neck – Shiva. One of the most
                beautiful temples near Pune, Neelkanteshwar temple is situated atop a hillock, 900 metre above sea
                level. To
                reach the temple, you will have to trek for about an hour making your journey all the more
                worthwhile.While
                the structure of the temple resembles South Indian temples, it is the aura and serenity of the temple
                that
                draws visitors. From beautiful sunsets to views of the valleys, the location of the temple offers
                beautiful
                scenery worth making that steep climb.It was built by a local villager named Pundalik Kanhore in the

                century, who found a Shivalinga on the hill and decided to construct a temple around it.
                It has more than 1500 statues of various Hindu gods and goddesses, as well as scenes from Hindu
                mythology,
                such as Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Samudra Manthan.
                It is a popular trekking destination, as it offers a scenic view of the surrounding valleys, rivers, and
                dams. The trek is about 2 km long and takes around 45 minutes to reach the temple from the base.

        <h3>Lakshmi Narsimha Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Dedicated to Lord Narasimha, one of the avatars of Lord Vishnu, Shri Laxmi Narasimha Temple is among the
                most
                beautiful temples in Pune. Built in the Peshwa architectural style with black stones, the temple took 20
                years to be completed and is located on the confluence of Bhima and Nira river. This location of the
                temple
                imparts it a surreal setting and elevates the entire aura of the temple.
                Apart from fortifying the temple against foreign invasions, the original idol of Lord Narasimha was
                replaced
                by a duplicate due to the fear of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. All this makes for an interesting history of
                the
                temple. However, if you want to see glorious celebrations of any Hindu festival, visit it during
                Vaishakha
                Navratra to see processions like Dahi Handi.
                Lakshmi Narsimha Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu, located in Pune
                district of Maharashtra. The temple is situated at the confluence of Bhima and Nira rivers, in Indapur
                taluka. The temple was built in 1787 in Peshwa architectural style, with a fortified west gate and a
                black
                stone idol of Narasimha. The temple also has several small shrines of other deities and a bell from a
                Portuguese church. The temple celebrates Vaisakha Navratri as its main festival.
                The temple is also a heritage site because of its association with the freedom fighter Vasudeo Balwant
                Phadke, who used to live there.
                The temple is believed to have a miraculous idol of Narasimha, which was brought from Panchvati by a
                Brahmin
                of Ratnagiri. Some devotees also claim to have seen the bricks of the pillar from which Narasimha
                emerged to
                kill Hiranyakashipu.<br></p>

        <h3>Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Dagadusheth Halwai Ganapati temple was built by a sweet seller named Dagadusheth Gadve. His guru
                suggested
                him to build the temple after his son died of a deadly disease.
                The temple’s architecture is quite unique because this is perhaps the only temple where you can see the
                idol
                of Lord Ganesha from outside. Not only the idol, but the inner sanctum is also visible from outside
                making
                it a perfect place to celebrate all the festivals with pomp and no restrictions.
                The 7.5 feet tall idol of Lord Ganesha is adorned with gold and precious gems which are offered by
                devotees
                from all over the world.The temple is a beautiful construction and boasts a rich history of over 100
                years.
                Jay and Vijay, the two sentinels made of marble catch the eye of all at the outset. The construction is
                so
                simple that all the proceedings in the temple along with the beautiful Ganesh idol can be seen even from
                outside.The lighting of the temple during the Ganesh festival is marvelous. Shrimant Dagdusheth Ganpati
                Trust looks into the maintenance of the temple. The temple is situated in the centre of city, local
                shopping
                market is also the nearby temple. Various cultural activities like music concerts, bhajans, and
                Atharvasheersh recitation are organized by the trust.<br></p>

        <h3>Sri Balaji Mandir</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Sri Balaji Mandir Pune is a close replica of the famous Balaji Temple of Tirumala, Tirupati. Therefore,
                people also call it Prati Balaji Mandir and Mini Balaji Mandir. It is built amidst lush green landscape,
                in
                a peaceful environment. And it is a treat for those who want to
                get the blessings of Lord Balaji. All pujas and sevas in this Balaji Mandir at Pune are performed by
                priests
                from the Tirupati Balaji Temple.Shree Balaji Mandir Pune is at Ketkawale, near Narayanpur. It is about
                45
                kilometres away from Pune. The road passes through green fields, gurgling streams and many small
                cascading
                waterfalls as you approach the temple. So, even the route to the temple is a memory worth savouring.The
                Tirupati Balaji Mandir near Pune has been constructed under the guidance of Tirumala Tirupati Temple
                Devasthanam.As you enter the premises, you'll come across the beautifully crafted entrance gate. It is
                made
                up of stone.
                The temple walls have carvings similar to the original temple. And the interior is decorated with
                woodwork.The black stone and other building materials used in the temple have been brought from
                Kanchipuram.
                And the main deity of the temple, Lord Balaji, is carved in wood. It is painted with grey oil paint. It
                took
                almost 7 years, from 1996 to 2003, to build this temple.<br></p>

        <h3>Parvati Hill Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>As the name suggests, the temple is located atop a hill, 2100 feet above sea level. To reach this
                beautiful
                temple in Pune, you will have to climb 103 steps. However, all the exhaustion from such a long climb
                will
                fade away when you finally see the temple, its idols and of course, the scenic view of the surrounding
                area.
                It is said that at the same place where the present temple stands, there used to be a smaller temple (or
                a
                shrine) where Nana Saheb’s mother used to go and pray. She was suffering from a disease and she vowed to
                build a larger temple once she was cured. The temple was then built by Nana Saheb, the third Peshwa.

        <h3>Pataleshwar Cave Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Situated on the Jangli Maharaj Road in Pune, Pataleshwar Cave Temple is enshrined by Lord Pataleshwar,
                the
                God of the Underworld, who is a form of Lord Shiva. Carved out of a single magnanimous rock, this
                spellbinding monolithic find is located right in the heart of the city and is a revered Hindu shrine
                which
                is thronged by hundreds of devotees and pilgrims on an everyday basis. Other than Lord Shiva, the temple
                is
                also dedicated to Nandi and has idols of other Hindu gods and goddesses as well including Lord Ram,
                Sita,
                Lakshmi, Lakshman, Ganesh etc. The construction of the temple was inspired by the majestic Elephanta
                Caves
                but it was left incomplete. For the same reason, the temple has no real entrance; the only major
                entrance is
                next to a banyan tree in the courtyard. The temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India
                (ASI). Thronged by a number of devotees and explorers, Pataleshwar Temple is of religious relevance to
                Hindus. With all those carvings and miniatures drawn on its wall, the centuries-old temple is a treat to
                the
                eyes.<br></p>

        <h3>Someshwar Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Someshwar Temple is a 900-year-old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located in Pashan, Pune. It was built
                by
                the mother of Shivaji Maharaj, Jijabai, in the Hemadpanthi style of black stone. The temple has a
                self-originating (Swayambhu) Shivalinga, which is believed to have been revealed by a cow that sprinkled
                milk over a snake hole. The temple also has a wooden assembly hall with intricate carvings, a deepstambh
                (lamp pillar), and other shrines of Hanuman, Bhairavnath, and Ganesha. The temple is situated near
                Nagzari,
                a stream that was once considered to have healing powers. One of the ashta pradhans of the Shivaji’s
                court,
                Hanumante, contributed to the renovation of the temple whose samadhi is present in the temple’s north
                side.
                There is also a sabha mandap, whose ceilings have wonderful carvings built by prominent Mughal general
                Shahiste Khan as repentance. The temple is built in black stone in the Hemadpanti sculpture with a deep
                mala
                of approximately 40 feet. It is surrounded by Bhairavnath, Hanuman, and Ganesh temple. <br></p>

        <h3>Kanifnath Temple</h3>
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                Kanifnath Temple is a temple dedicated to Kanifnath, one of the nine saints of the Navnath Sampradaya, a
                Hindu sect. The temple is located in Bopgaon, near Saswad, Pune. The temple was built in the 14th
                century
                and has a unique feature of a small window-like entrance, through which only men can enter by crawling.
                Women are not allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum, where the idol of Kanifnath is placed. The temple is
                surrounded by scenic hills and offers a panoramic view of the area. The temple is a popular destination
                for
                pilgrims and trekkers. Kanifnath temple’s name comes from a Hindu saint, Kanhoba, also called Kanifnath,
                one
                of the Navnath Sampradaya’s Mahayogi. This temple’s view is pretty impressive, with morning prayers and
                music in the background, one of the most spectacular views in the morning. <br></p>
