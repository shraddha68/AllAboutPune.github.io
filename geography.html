            <h4>Latitude:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pune is situated at approximately 18.5204° N latitude.</li>
                <li>Latitude measures how far north or south a location is from the equator, which is the imaginary line
                    that circles the Earth halfway between the North and South Poles.</li>
                <li>In the case of Pune, its latitude indicates that it is located in the northern hemisphere, roughly
                    18.5
                    degrees north of the equator.</li>
                <li>The city's position in the northern hemisphere means that it experiences seasons opposite to those
                    in
                    the southern hemisphere.</li>
                <li>Pune's summers typically occur from March to June, while winters are from November to February.</li>

                    runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and passes through Greenwich, England.</li>
                <li>Pune's longitude indicates that it is situated east of the Prime Meridian, approximately 73.9
                    degrees
                    east.</li>
                <li>As Pune is located to the east of the Prime Meridian, it is ahead of Coordinated Universal Time
                    (UTC) by
                    several hours. India Standard Time (IST), which Pune follows, is UTC+5:30, meaning Pune is 5 hours
                    and
                    30 minutes ahead of UTC.</li>

                <li>Pune is situated at a moderate elevation compared to other cities and regions.</li>
                <li>While not as high as mountainous areas, its altitude still has significant effects on factors such
                    as
                    climate, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="box2">
            <h4>Impact on Climate: </h4>

                <li>The city experiences a tropical wet and dry climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons.
                </li>
                <li>The elevation helps mitigate
                    extreme temperatures, resulting in milder summers and winters compared to low-lying coastal areas.

        <div class="box2">
            <h4>Temperature Variations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Altitude influences temperature variations within Pune.</li>
                <li>Generally, higher altitudes
                    experience cooler temperatures, while lower altitudes tend to be warmer.</li>
                <li>However, in Pune's case, the impact of
                    altitude on temperature is relatively moderate due to its elevation not being extremely high.

                <li>Pune's altitude influences the flow of rivers and streams in the region.</li>
                <li>The city's higher elevation
                    compared to neighboring areas allows for gravitational water flow towards lower-lying regions,
                    affecting

    <div class="naturalhazards">
        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Flooding:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>During the monsoon season, heavy rainfall can lead to flooding in low-lying areas of Pune,
                    particularly along riverbanks and in poorly drained areas.</li>
                <li>Urbanization and improper stormwater drainage systems exacerbate the risk of flooding, causing
                    waterlogging and property damage.</li>
                <li>Flash floods can occur in hilly regions and urban areas with inadequate drainage infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li style="list-style: none;"><img src="mulamutha flood 2018.jpg"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Urban Heat Island Effect:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapid urbanization and expansion of concrete structures in Pune have led to the formation of urban
                    heat islands, where temperatures are higher than surrounding rural areas.</li>
                <li>Increased heat retention by buildings and pavements, reduced green cover, and heat-generating
                    activities contribute to elevated temperatures, especially during the summer months.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Air Pollution:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pune experiences high levels of air pollution, particularly during the winter months, due to
                    vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and biomass burning.</li>
                <li>Poor air quality can have adverse health effects, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular
                    diseases, and exacerbation of existing conditions.</li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;"><img src="ht-pune_d713680c-581d-11e8-b87b-3dd7d8bd63e9.avif"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Earthquakes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pune is located in a seismically active region, with the potential for earthquakes due to its
                    proximity to major fault lines such as the Koyna-Warna fault and the Deccan Trap faults.</li>
                <li>While Pune has not experienced significant earthquakes in recent history, the risk remains, and
                    preparedness measures are essential to mitigate potential impacts on infrastructure and communities.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Heatwaves:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pune experiences heatwaves during the summer months, with temperatures often soaring above 40°C
                    (104°F).</li>
                <li>Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat-related illnesses, dehydration, and heat
                    stress, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and outdoor workers.</li>

        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Drought:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite its relatively wet climate during the monsoon season, Pune and its surrounding regions can
                    experience drought conditions during periods of inadequate rainfall.</li>
                <li>Droughts can have severe implications for agriculture, water supply, and socio-economic activities,
                    leading to crop failures, water shortages, and livelihood challenges.</li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;"><img src="b286f768-7fec-4364-8344-3c6e19eefc4e.jpg"></li>

        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <h4>Landslides:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hilly areas surrounding Pune are susceptible to landslides, especially during the monsoon season
                    when heavy rainfall saturates the soil and destabilizes slopes.</li>
                <li>Deforestation, improper land use practices, and construction activities in landslide-prone areas
                    increase the risk of landslides and soil erosion.</li>

            <h4>Cyclones and Tropical Storms:</h4>

                <li>While Pune is located inland, it can still experience the effects of cyclones and tropical storms
                    originating from the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal, resulting in heavy rainfall, strong winds,
                    and associated hazards.</li>
